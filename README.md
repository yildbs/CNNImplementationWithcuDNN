# When you clone this project...
The size of this project is very large because of some binary files including tensor weight files, dll files. Lately i removed the big size files. So clone with '--depth=1' option like command below. You can clone fast enough.
git clone https://github.com/yildbs/Deep-Leaning-On-C-with-cuDNN --depth=1
